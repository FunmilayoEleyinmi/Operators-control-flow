/* 2. For each JavaScript Operator, give two examples
a. Arithmetic Operator
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
 let sum = x + y;
 console.log(sum);

 let division = y / x;
 console.log(division);

 let fruits = 5;
 console.log(++fruits);

 b. Assignment Operator
let a = 5;
 a += 5;
 console.log(a);

 let b = 2;
 b *= 4;
 console.log(b);

c. Comparison Operator
let c = 10;
console.log(c >= 11);

let cars = 50;
let bicycles = '70';
console.log(cars === bicycles);

d. Logical Operator
 let Anatomy = 'Pass';
 let Pathology = 'Pass';
 (Anatomy === 'Pass' && Pathology === 'Pass') ? console.log('move to 4th year') : console.log('repeat same year');
 (Anatomy ==='Pass' || Pathology === 'Pass') ? console.log('move to 4th year') : console.log('repeat the same year');

e. Bitwise Operator
let number = 5 | 1;
console.log(number);

let num = ~5;
console.log(num);
